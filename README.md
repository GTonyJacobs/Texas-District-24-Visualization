# Texas District 24 voting visualization

In December 2021, I spoke with a friend who was exploring options about running for office in the following year's midterm elections. The congressional district map of Texas has just been redrawn, so there was little information available on past voting patterns of the new districts.

I offered to look at precinct data and come up with a profile for the new District 24, so that my friend could evaluate her prospects of running to be its representative. At the time, I had no training as a data analyst, and was a full-time professor of mathematics. However, I was confident that I could provide a meaningful summary report of voting patterns.

Searching through public records, I was able to locate voting data, on various county websites, from the 2020 presidential election for each precinct in the new District 24. I compiled the data into a spreadsheet, filtered it for relevant precincts, cleaned it to obtain a uniform format, and calculated totals by city, with (all or parts of) twenty-one different cities being represented within the district.

Finally, I used those totals to create a visualization.

Precincts on the map are color coded by city, and each city is also repesented by a circle placed near it. The area of each circle proportional to each city's population within the district, and the red-to-blue colors of the circles represent the percentage of voters within each city's District 24 precincts who voted Republican vs Democrat in the 2020 presidential election. To create the image, I used MS Paint, being at that time unfamiliar with more standard tools, such as Tableau and Power BI.

The work that I put into this project was an inspiration for my eventual decision to change careers, and to pursue data in earnest. Producing the visualization was satisfying, in that I was able to distill from a sea of numbers an engaging and easy-to-understand graphic. At the same time, I realized that there must be better tools available for this kind of report, and I wanted to explore what I could do with more powerful software, both for the analysis and for the visualization.
