# Texas District 24 voting visualization

In December 2021, I spoke with a friend who was exploring options about running for office in the following midterm elections. The congressional districts of Texas has just been redrawn that year, so there was little information available on past voting patterns of the new districts. I offered to look at precinct data and come up with a profile for the new District 24, so that my friend could evaluate her prospects of running to be its representative.

At the time, I had no training as a data analyst, and was a full-time professor of mathematics. However, I was confident that I could come up with some kind of useful summary, being somewhat adept with numbers and spreadsheets. The work that I put into this project was an inspiration for my eventual decision to change careers, and to pursue data in earnest.

Searching through public records, I was able to locate voting data, on various county websites, from the 2020 presidential election for each precinct in the new District 24. I compiled the data into a spreadsheet, filtered it for relevant precincts, cleaned it to obtain a uniform format, and calcluated totals by city, with (all or parts of) twenty-one different cities being represented within the district.

Finally, I used those totals to create a [Voting Map of District 24](/images/Texas_District_24.jpg). To create the image, I used MS Paint, being at that time unfamiliar with more standard tools, such as Tableau or Power BI.
